<h1>About Angela </h1>
<p>Hello! I'm a compsci student at UNSW.<br>
    I've travelled a fair few places and have just about a dozen hobbies and skills. <br>
    Unfortunately, that does not, at the moment, include CSS. It does include C, javascript, typescript and basic html. <br>
    My current obsession is calligraphy and growing basils. A picture of my basil:
    <img src="basil.jpg" alt="My Basil in 2025 February!"> <br>
    I like art, music and anything creative, and I really love discovering new and fun online tools.<br>
    Now, to address the theme, and to make it more useful...

<h2> Travel Recommendations and Light Roast </h2>
<p> Argentina: Tango is a must see; don't show wealth.<br>
    Antarctica: Penguins are adorable; don't visit when ice caps have melted -e.g. late Feb.<br> 
    Australia: Nature is awesome; the Sun is sunning.<br>
    China: Eat like a king; vpn is unreliable, roaming is necessary. <br>
    Japan: Good snow and old towns; tourists and waiting in lines. <br> 
    Singapore: Small but competitive country, logical regulations; high-stress lifestyle.<br>
    Italy: Sculpture and art heaven; drivers.<br>
    Germany: Godly Schintzel; a lot of smoking.<br>
    UK: Window shopping is a delight; Sherlock Holmes Museum in London.<br>
